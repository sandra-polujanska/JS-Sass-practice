    <h2>Jah Children Cry lyrics</h2>
        <p>
            Why..

            It's been too long.. slaving inna Babylon, Babylon.
            It's been too long.. slaving inna Babylon, Babylon.
            Time for us all, to unite..
            Time for us all, to unite..

            Come on my brothers!
            Come on my sisters!
            We've got to fight with all our might.
            We have been slaving, for over 4000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure to reach the top one day.
            We must reach the top, I say.
            Sure to reach the top one day, yeah-eh.
            We have been struggling, for over 4000 years.

            Why..
            Jah children cry?
            (Jah children cry..)

            We've got to fight with all our might, yeah.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why..

            We have been slaving, for over 4000 years.
            Why..
            Jah children cry?
            (Jah children cry..)

            Got to reach the top one day.
            Say we must reach the top, I say.
            Must reach the top one day..
